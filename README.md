# Registry

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/deis/registry.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/deis/registry)

A Docker image registry for use in the Deis open source PaaS.

This Docker image is based on alpine linux and uses the official Docker V2 registry code.

Deis (pronounced DAY-iss) is an open source PaaS that makes it easy to deploy and manage
applications on your own servers. Deis builds on [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io/) to provide
a lightweight, [Heroku-inspired](http://heroku.com) workflow.

## Deploying

If you want to use the latest registry image built by they Deis team you can simply start a registry via `make deploy`.

If however, you want to build and use a custom image see the instructions below.

## Build and Deploy

To build a dev release of this image, you will also need a registry to hold the custom images. This can be your own registry, Dockerhub, or Quay.


First, configure your environment to point to the registry location.

```console
$ export DEIS_REGISTRY=myregistry.com:5000  # or quay.io, if using Dockerhub, leave this unset
$ export IMAGE_PREFIX=youruser/             # if using Quay or Dockerhub
```

To build and push the image run:

```console
$ make docker-build docker-push
```

Before deploying your custom image you must update the container image specification in the pod manifest. This file is found at `contrib/kubernetes/manifests/registry-rc.yaml`:

```yaml
        - name: registry
          image: quay.io/youruser/registry:git-f5c7dc3
          env:
            - name: REGISTRY_STORAGE_DELETE_ENABLED
              value: "true"
```

By default registry uses the filesystem as the storage medium. To use a custom object store like s3, gcs or azure:
- First provide the details required for authenticating to object store in base64 format by updating the secret file which can be found at `contrib/kubernetes/manifests/registry-{STORAGE_TYPE}-secret.yaml`.
- Update the storage type and secret to be used in the pod manifest. This file is found at `contrib/kubernetes/manifests/registry-rc.yaml`:
```yaml
        - name: REGISTRY_STORAGE
          value: filesystem
          
        - name: registry-creds
          secret:
            secretName: fs-keyfile
```
- Set the STORAGE_TYPE environment variable.
```
$ export STORAGE_TYPE = {s3/gcs/azure}
```

Once updated, deploy the registry to your kubernetes cluster with:

```
$ make deploy
```

After a while, you should see one pod up with one running:

```
NAME                  READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
registry-6wy8o        1/1       Running   0          32s
```

You can then interact with this pod as you would with any other Kubernetes pod:

```
$ kubectl logs -f registry-6wy8o
$ kubectl exec -it registry-6wy8o sh
```
