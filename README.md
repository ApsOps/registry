# Registry

A Docker image registry for use in the Deis open source PaaS.

This Docker image is based on the official docker distribution image.

Please add any [issues](https://github.com/deis/registry/issues) you find with this software to the [Distribution Project](https://github.com/docker/distribution).


## Deploying

To build a dev release of this image, you will also need your own registry, but DockerHub or Quay will do fine here. To build, run:

```
$ export DEIS_REGISTRY=myregistry.com:5000
$ make docker-build docker-push
```

This will compile the Docker image and push it to your registry.

After that, run

```
$ make deploy
```

Which will deploy the component to kubernetes. After a while, you should see one pod up with one running:

```
NAME                  READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
registry-6wy8o        1/1       Running   0          32s
```

You can then query this pod as you would with any other Kubernetes pod:

```
$ kubectl logs -f registry-6wy8o
$ kubectl exec -it registry-6wy8o psql
```
